# These are the properties of the CommerceItem which will be loaded to the repository.
# If a class implements CommerceItem or extends a class which implements CommerceItem,
# all properties which should be loaded should be listed here. By default a
# property name listed here will be loaded to the cooresponding repository item
# property with the same name. If the name in the bean and repository are not
# the same then it can be mapped in the property beanPropertyToPropertyDescriptorMap
# below.
