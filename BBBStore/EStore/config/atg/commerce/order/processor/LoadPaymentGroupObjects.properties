# These are the properties of the PaymentGroup which will be loaded to the repository.
# If a class implements PaymentGroup or extends a class which implements PaymentGroup,
# all properties which should be loaded should be listed here. By default a
# property name listed here will be loaded to the cooresponding repository item
# property with the same name. If the name in the bean and repository are not
# the same then it can be mapped in the property propertyDescriptorToBeanPropertyMap
